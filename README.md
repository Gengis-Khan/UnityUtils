# UnityUtils

This repository contains some of the assets that I like to import every time I make a new project. 
The main focus is in the scripts, containing some Extension Methods for Unity's classes I like to use when coding.
It also contains some simple graphic assets and prefabs that can be used both for debugging or as a starting point for the creation of new content.
